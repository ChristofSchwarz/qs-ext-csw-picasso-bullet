# picassojs Barchart for Qlik Sense
Qlik Sense Extension to plot a bar chart with target line using PicassoJs

It shows how a particular Json configuration of a PicassoJs chart, which runs with sample data on https://beta.observablehq.com/@miralemd/picasso-js-labeling-bars , will be wrapped into a Qlik Sense extension to bind data to a qHypercube 

It needs
* One dimension to iterate over
* Three measures
   * Bar length
   * Target comparison rendered as a marker line
   * Hexcode of the bar color (text like '#fea023')
